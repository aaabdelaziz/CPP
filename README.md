# C++ Code Repository

Welcome to my C++ Code Repository! This repository serves as a personal reference for my coding journey, showcasing a collection of C++ code examples ranging from basic to advanced concepts, design patterns, and best practices.

## Contents

- **Basic C++ Codes**: Fundamental examples to help beginners get started with C++.
- **Advanced C++ Codes**: More complex implementations that delve deeper into the language features.
- **Design Patterns**: Examples demonstrating common design patterns and their implementations in C++.
- **Best Practices**: Coding standards and practices that promote better coding habits.
- **Future Enhancements**: 
  - Codes will be updated to include best practices from C++20 and C++23.
  - Additional data structures implemented in C++ will be added later.

## Current Coverage

The repository currently covers code examples related to C++11 and C++17. 
Each example is designed to be comprehensible and illustrative, enabling learners to grasp and apply the concepts effectively.

The repository is not professionally complete yet; So, I keep updating it from time to time.

## Getting Started

To explore the codes in this repository, simply clone the repo to your local machine and navigate through the various directories. You can compile and run the examples using a standard C++ compiler from terminal using g++.
