Fast insertion and deletion
but bad in find or search 

The list is a doubly-linked list implementation provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
 
 A linked list is a data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next and, in the case of a doubly-linked list, also to the previous node in the sequence.


Doubly-Linked Structure:
Each element in the list is represented by a node that contains the data and two pointers: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.
This doubly-linked structure allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements at both the beginning and end of the list, as well as in the middle.


No Random Access:

Unlike arrays or vectors, std::list does not provide direct random access to elements using an index. Accessing elements requires traversing the list from the beginning or end.
